This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Running the demo

Make sure to install the dependencies using `yarn install` or `npm install`, then run the app using `yarn start` or `npm run start` command.

This demonstration is _responsive_ and uses the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework for styling of HTML elements. So in case the CSS needs to be rebuilt, it can be done using `yarn build:css` or `npm run build:css` command.

#### Viewing the redux events

Since the app uses [Redux Toolkit ](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), the state changes and dispatched actions can be examined using Redux Dev Tools.
